          <span>Frontend Developer/ UI/UX Designer / Software QA Engineer</span>
          <p>
            I'm a passionate Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer who loves
            turning ideas into clean, interactive, and user-focused digital
            experiences. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, I specialize in
            building responsive web interfaces using React and Vite for fast and
            efficient development. I care deeply about the user experience and
            design systems, which drives my attention to both detail and
            functionality. I'm also skilled in Figma, where I design intuitive,
            modern UI mockups and prototypes. From wireframes to polished
            interfaces, I enjoy every step of the design-to-code journey.
            Whether Iâ€™m designing a sleek mobile UI or developing a dynamic web
            app, I strive to create products that are both beautiful and usable.
